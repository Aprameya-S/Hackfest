# VitalFund
VitalFund is a platform that facilitates multi-user crowdfunding for health-related campaigns. The goal of this project is to develop an online crowdfunding platform for healthcare that utilizes blockchain technology and cryptocurrency transactions to provide secure, transparent, and efficient funding for medical treatments.

We believe in the power of community and collaboration. Our platform facilitates multi-user crowdfunding, enabling individuals to join forces, pool their resources, and make a greater impact together. Whether you're an individual in need of financial assistance for a medical treatment or a compassionate supporter looking to make a difference, our platform provides a trusted space for you to connect and create positive change.

To create a crowdfunding campaign, users can easily connect to their Metamask wallet or other compatible wallets and seamlessly initiate their fundraising efforts with minimal effort. The platform offers an intuitive interface that supports the uploading of an image for visual reference and a comprehensive description of their medical condition. Users can effortlessly browse all active campaigns, connect their wallets, and make donations to the campaign of their choice. To track and monitor all their activities and transactions, both donors and beneficiaries can conveniently access their profiles page.

Drawbacks of conventional online crowdfunding platforms:\
❌ Lack of regulation: A study published in the Journal of Medical Ethics found that many crowdfunding campaigns for healthcare funding are not regulated by government agencies, such as the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO), which can lead to misuse of funds.

❌ Inequitable distribution: Crowdfunding campaigns for healthcare funding tend to favor certain medical conditions over others. For example, cancer campaigns tend to raise more money than campaigns for mental health or rare diseases. This can create an uneven playing field and leave some patients with insufficient funds.

❌ Limited reach: Most transactions are local due to the constraints of national currency.

How VitalFund tackles these problems:\
✅ Blockchain technology allows for a decentralized network, meaning that no central authority or intermediary is controlling the transactions. This reduces the risk of fraud or corruption, as all transactions are transparent and can be traced back to their source. Other online crowdfunding platforms tend to hold the funds until the campaign ends or till the beneficiary manually collects the funds. This opens the door to possible mismanagement of funds. Our platform facilitates a direct transaction between donor and beneficiary which eliminates the problem of fund management.

✅ Our platform is impartial to campaigns providing equal exposure to all campaigns.

✅ Global reach: Cryptocurrency transactions allow for instant, borderless transactions, which means that donors from all over the world can contribute to a healthcare crowdfunding campaign. This increases the potential pool of donors and can help to raise funds more quickly.

VitalFund offers significant advantages over other crowdfunding platforms, including: ⌦ Data security measures facilitated by the use of blockchain technology ⌦ Ensured transaction security through the implementation of smart contracts and Metamask integration ⌦ Streamlined fund disbursement, whereby funds are directly transferred to the beneficiary's account, eliminating the need for manual collection as is often required on other platforms ⌦ Real-time tracking of campaign progress and transaction status, providing users with up-to-date and transparent information throughout the crowdfunding process.
